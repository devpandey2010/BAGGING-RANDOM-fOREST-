Bagging and Random Forest

Overview
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) and Random Forest are ensemble learning techniques primarily used to improve the accuracy and stability of machine learning models. Both techniques use multiple models (often decision trees) to make predictions, combining them to produce a more robust and generalized model.

Bagging
Bagging is a method that trains multiple models independently using different subsets of the training data, generated through bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement). The predictions of these models are then aggregated (e.g., by averaging for regression or voting for classification) to produce the final output.

Key Features:

Reduces overfitting by averaging multiple predictions.

Works well with high-variance models like decision trees.

Improves accuracy and reduces variance in predictions.

Steps in Bagging:

Generate multiple bootstrapped datasets from the training data.

Train a separate model (e.g., decision tree) on each bootstrapped dataset.

Aggregate the predictions from all models.

Random Forest

Random Forest builds upon bagging by introducing an additional layer of randomness. In addition to bootstrapping the training data, Random Forest also selects a random subset of features for each split while training decision trees.

Use Cases:

Fraud detection.

Customer churn prediction.

Medical diagnosis.

Image and text classification.
